# Effect-of-Macroeconomic-indicators-on-Financial-Institution

# Banks are imperative Cog of the Economy.
Macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and unemployment significantly impact financial institutions by influencing their lending practices, profitability, credit risk, and overall stability. 

üìå Introduction
This project expands on the Multivariate Time-Series Analysis of Macroeconomic Data by conducting a detailed stability assessment of financial institutions in Zambia. We will analyze how key macroeconomic indicators such as Inflation, Interest Rates, Exchange Rates, and GDP Growth‚Äîaffect the banking sector, focusing on scenario analysis. 

By integrating these techniques, we will assess how shocks in macroeconomic variables impact banking sector resilience, including capital adequacy, loan default rates, and liquidity risk. Because this is an expanssion to (Multivariate Time-Series Analysis of Macroeconomic Data), we will skipp first three steps to avoid repetiosion of process and move direct to step 4.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis
To understand the resilience of financial institutions, we will conduct:

üîπ Historical Stress Testing:
Identify past macroeconomic crises in Zambia (e.g., high inflation periods, currency devaluation).
Assess how these crises affected banking stability indicators (NPLs, CAR, liquidity ratios, etc.).

üîπ Hypothetical Scenario Analysis:
We will create 3 stress test scenarios:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Mild Scenario: Inflation increases by 2%, interest rates rise by 2%.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Moderate Scenario: Exchange rate depreciates by 10%.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Severe Scenario: A financial crisis leads to a 15% inflation surge, 15% currency depreciation, and a 5% interest rate hike.

üìä Steps:

- Simulate macroeconomic shocks based on historical crisis patterns.
- Model the impact of shocks on loan defaults, bank liquidity, and profitability.
- Interpret results to assess which macro factors pose the greatest risk to financial stability.
